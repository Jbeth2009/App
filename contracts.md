# Crunchyroll Replica - API Contracts & Integration Plan

## Current Frontend Implementation
The frontend is fully functional with mock data and includes:
- Hero carousel with featured anime
- Multiple content sections (Popular, Featured, Action, etc.)
- Search functionality with real-time filtering
- Video player with YouTube integration
- Responsive design matching Crunchyroll's aesthetic

## Mock Data Currently Used
- `featuredAnime`: 4 main anime with full details (Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, One Piece, My Hero Academia)
- `seasonalAnime`: 4 seasonal anime (Jujutsu Kaisen, Tokyo Revengers, Chainsaw Man, Spy x Family) 
- `demonSlayerEpisodes`: Sample episodes for Demon Slayer series
- All anime include: title, description, image, rating, year, episodes, status, genres, trailer URLs

## API Endpoints Needed (if backend expansion desired)

GET /api/featured - Get featured anime for hero carousel
GET /api/popular - Get popular/trending anime
